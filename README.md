# Xmrit

Xmrit is the easiest tool to work with the [XmR process-control chart](https://xmrit.com/about/). It is a simple web-based application that allows you to create a chart by pasting in data, interacting with the chart, and sharing it.

A live version of the tool is available at http://xmrit.com/t/ . You can find more details on the tool by reading the [user manual](https://xmrit.com/manual/) or the [integration guide](https://xmrit.com/integration/). All data is stored in your browser and will never be shared with anyone (including us!) as per our [privacy policy](https://xmrit.com/privacy/).
